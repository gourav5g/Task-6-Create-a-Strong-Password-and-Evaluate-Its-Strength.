# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.


## 🧰 TASK 6: CREATE AND EVALUATE STRONG PASSWORDS

### ✅ Objective:
Understand what makes a password strong by creating various passwords, testing them using online tools, and analyzing the results.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Create Multiple Passwords**
Generate at least **5 passwords** with varying complexity:
| Password | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Password123` | Weak (common word + numbers) |
| `Secure@Pass!987` | Medium (mix of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers) |
| `MyP@ssw0rdIsStr0ng!` | Strong |
| `PurpleTiger$RunsFast42#` | Very strong (passphrase style) |
| `aB3#xK9!Lmz@Qwerty$` | Random, high entropy |

---

### 2. **Use Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, Length Variations**

Make sure your passwords include:
- At least one uppercase letter (`A-Z`)
- One lowercase letter (`a-z`)
- One number (`0-9`)
- One special character (`!@#$%^&*`)
- Length > 12 characters is ideal

---

### 3. **Test Each Password on a Password Strength Checker**

### 4. **Note Scores and Feedback from the Tool**

| Password | Score (out of 100) | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| `Password123` | 15 | Instantly | Too common |
| `Secure@Pass!987` | 85 | Years | Good mix |
| `MyP@ssw0rdIsStr0ng!` | 92 | Centuries | Very good |
| `PurpleTiger$RunsFast42#` | 98 | Millennia | Excellent |
| `aB3#xK9!Lmz@Qwerty$` | 100 | Millions of years | Perfect |

---

### 5. **Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords**

✅ Best Practices:
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common words or patterns like `1234`, `qwerty`
- Use passphrases (e.g., "PurpleTiger$RunsFast42#")
- Don’t reuse passwords across accounts
- Use a **password manager**

---

### 6. **Write Down Tips Learned**

📝 Tips:
- Longer passwords are harder to crack.
- Randomness increases security.
- Avoid personal info like birthdays or names.
- Passphrases are easier to remember and stronger.
- Tools can help you evaluate strength before use.

---

### 7. **Research Common Password Attacks**

#### 🔐 Brute Force Attack:
- Tries every possible combination until it finds the correct password.
- Takes longer with increased length and complexity.

#### 📚 Dictionary Attack:
- Uses a list of known words or common passwords.
- Can crack weak passwords in seconds.

#### 🕵️ Credential Stuffing:
- Reuses stolen login credentials from one site to try others.

---

### 8. **Summarize How Password Complexity Affects Security**

🔹 **Summary:**
- **Length + Complexity = Better Security**
- Short passwords (8–10 chars) can be cracked quickly.
- Adding symbols and increasing length exponentially increases cracking time.
- Using unique, random passwords prevents dictionary attacks.
- Passphrases offer usability and security.

## 📄 Sample Summary Report

### 🔒 Title: Password Strength Evaluation Report  
**Date:** [09/06/2025]  
**Analyst:** [Name- Gourav Niroula]

### 🧾 Overview:
This report evaluates several passwords using online strength checkers to understand how complexity affects password security. The goal was to identify best practices and assess resistance against brute force and dictionary attacks.

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
- Manual creation of sample passwords

### 📊 Results Table:

| Password | Score | Crack Time | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| `Password123` | 15 | Instant | Very weak, common word |
| `Secure@Pass!987` | 85 | Years | Good mix of characters |
| `MyP@ssw0rdIsStr0ng!` | 92 | Centuries | Strong, not common |
| `PurpleTiger$RunsFast42#` | 98 | Millennia | Great passphrase |
| `aB3#xK9!Lmz@Qwerty$` | 100 | Millions of years | Highly secure |

### 💡 Key Findings:
- Longer passwords take more time to crack.
- Mixing uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols improves strength.
- Avoid predictable patterns or reused passwords.
- Passphrases are both memorable and secure.

### 🧠 Recommendations:
- Use a **password manager** (e.g., Bitwarden, KeePass)
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- Use **unique passwords** for each account
- Change passwords regularly if compromised

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. **What makes a password strong?**
> A strong password has:
> - At least 12 characters
> - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
> - No common words or patterns
> - High randomness and uniqueness

---

### 2. **What are common password attacks?**
> - **Brute Force**: Tries all combinations
> - **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common passwords
> - **Credential Stuffing**: Reuses leaked credentials
> - **Phishing**: Tricks users into revealing passwords

---

### 3. **Why is password length important?**
> Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks impractical.

---

### 4. **What is a dictionary attack?**
> An attack that uses precompiled lists of common passwords instead of trying every possible combination.

---

### 5. **What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?**
> MFA adds an extra layer beyond just a password—like a code from a phone app or biometric scan—to improve account security.

---

### 6. **How do password managers help?**
> They generate strong, unique passwords and store them securely, so users don't have to remember complex strings.

---

### 7. **What are passphrases?**
> Passphrases are long, easy-to-remember phrases used as passwords (e.g., `PurpleTiger$RunsFast42#`). They’re more secure than short passwords.

---

### 8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**
> - Using short passwords
> - Reusing passwords
> - Including personal info
> - Using common patterns like `1234`, `qwerty`, or `password`
